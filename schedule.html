												      <span class="abs"> Using PSA Dynamics to Optimize Docetaxel Scheduling in Metastatic Prostate Cancer Patients Receiving Hormone Therapy</span>
															<p class="text-justify mr-2 ml-2"><small class="text-muted text-justify">Prostate cancer (PCa) is the second most common cancer in American men and the fifth leading cause of death worldwide. Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) has been the mainstay treatment for advanced prostate cancer (PCa) for the past 70 years. Unfortunately, continuous treatment results in the competitive release of the resistant phenotype, causing the inevitable development of castration-resistant PCa (CRPC). While the addition of chemotherapeutics, such as docetaxel, in metastatic CRPC has been shown to extend survival by between 4.7 and 13.6 months compared to ADT alone, when and how to apply such treatment remains unclear. In fact, administering docetaxel concurrently with ADT prior to the development of CRPC has been shown to extend survival by 8.5 months when compared to ADT alone. We hypothesize that early PSA dynamics can be used to determine the optimal time to administer docetaxel on a per-patient basis. We simulate prostate-specific antigen (PSA) dynamics using a mathematical model of PCa stem and differentiated cell interactions, which is calibrated to longitudinal PSA data from 56 castration naive patients receiving concurrent therapy and 36 castration resistant patients receiving ADT alone followed by concurrent therapy after CRPC development. We use the calibrated model to simulate concurrent therapy administered before and after the development of CRPC and analyze early treatment dynamics to determine the optimal time for concurrent therapy in individual patients. Model simulations based on early response identify when patients receive the most benefit from concurrent docetaxel, demonstrating the feasibility and potential value of clinical trials guided by patient-specific mathematical models of intratumoral evolutionary dynamics.</small>

												      <span class="abs">Spatial structure impacts adaptive therapy by shaping intra-tumoral competition</span></br>
															<p class="text-justify mr-2 ml-2"><small class="text-muted text-justify">Adaptive therapy aims to tackle cancer drug resistance by leveraging intra-tumoral competition between drug-sensitive and resistant cells. So far, most adaptive therapy models have represented competition using a Lotka-Volterra term. However, this is a phenomenological model and only provides limited mechanistic insight. What does the competitive landscape of a resistant cell actually look like, and which factors determine how strongly a cell is impacted by competition?  To address these questions we examine a simple, 2-D, on-lattice, agent-based model, in which cells are considered to be either fully drug sensitive or resistant. We compare continuous drug administration and the adaptive schedule pioneered in the first-in-human clinical trial. Previously, we and others have shown that the degree of crowding, the initial resistance fraction, the presence of resistance costs, and the rate of tumour cell turnover are key determinants of the benefit of adaptive therapy. The current model corroborates this conclusion, and we show how these factors alter spatial competition between cells. We draw two main conclusions: i) Turnover is a key modulator of the impact of spatial competition, and ii) not only inter-specific competition but also intra-specific competition of resistant cells with each other is important during adaptive therapy. An implication of this second finding is that the spatial distribution of resistant cells within the tumour is a crucial factor impacting AT. To illustrate this point, we fit the model to prostate-specific antigen data from 67 patients from an intermittent androgen-deprivation therapy trial. This shows how differences in resistance cost and turnover change the tumour's spatial organisation and may explain differences in cycling speed observed. Our work provides insights into how adaptive therapy leverages inter- and intra-specific competition to control resistance, and shows that accurate quantification of competition within a tumour, taking into account both cell-intrinsic factors and the tumour spatial architecture, will be important in assessing the quantitative benefit of adaptive therapy in patients.</small></p>

															<p class="text-justify mr-2 ml-2"><small class="text-muted text-justify">The standard of care (SoC) treatment for cancer patients aims to eradicate the tumor by killing the maximum number of cancer cells using the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of a cancer drug. Continuous therapy at such a high dose selects for resistant cells and the tumor soon becomes refractory to treatment in addition to causing significant side-effects and toxicity to the patient. Adaptive therapy tailors the treatment to an individual patient by  monitoring the tumor burden at fixed intervals and adjusting the drug dose accordingly with the aim of maximizing time to progression (TTP). Utilizing a hybrid agent-based model, we simulated adaptive therapy and strive to find some guiding principles to implement adaptive therapy in practice. Dose-adjustment algorithms (cocktail tandem, ping-pong every dose, ping-pong on progression) as well as fixed-dose algorithms (AT-2, intermittent) lead to lower tumor burden and increased TTP relative to MTD. Adaptive therapy works better when cell turnover rates are high. TTP can be increased if a dividing cell can replace a neighboring cell. Adaptive therapy works across a wide spectrum of forward and reverse mutation rates. Taking frequent treatment vacations when no drug is administered if the tumor burden falls below a threshold helps to increase TTP. We found that, in general, lower thresholds of how much the tumor must grow or shrink in order to trigger a dose adjustment, delayed progression the longest, and kept tumor burden at a minimum. The amount that the drug dose is changed mattered less. This suggests that we should change doses when we can detect a change in tumor size, and that optimizing adaptive therapy will likely only be limited by measurement error of our assays.</small></p>

												      <p class="text-justify mr-2 ml-2">
															<small class="text-muted">In the absence of curative therapies, treatment of metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) using currently available drugs can be improved by integrating evolutionary principles that govern proliferation of resistant subpopulations into current treatment protocols. Here we develop what is coined as an `evolutionary stable therapy', within the context of the mathematical model that has been used to inform the first adaptive therapy clinical trial of mCRPC. In an ‚Äòextreme‚Äô interpretation of adaptive therapy, the objective of this therapy is to maintain a stable polymorphic tumor heterogeneity of sensitive and resistant cells to therapy in order to prolong treatment efficacy and progression free survival. Optimal control analysis shows that an increasing dose titration protocol, a very common clinical dosing process, can achieve tumor stabilization for a wide range of potential initial tumor compositions and volumes. Furthermore, larger tumor volumes may counter intuitively be more likely to be stabilized if sensitive cells dominate the tumor composition at time of initial treatment, suggesting a delay of initial treatment could prove beneficial. While it remains uncertain if metastatic disease in humans has the properties that allow it to be truly stabilized, the benefits of a dose titration protocol warrant additional pre-clinical and clinical investigations.</small>

												      <p class="text-justify mr-2 ml-2">
															<small class="text-muted">Although the term mathematical oncology was coined by R. Gatenby and P. Maini in 2003, historically the use of mathematical modeling in clinical oncology dates back at least to the 1980's with population pharmacokinetic modeling being applied to clinical trial design and dose individualization. Complemented with pharmacodynamic modeling, these approaches form what is called pharmacometrics. They have a major focus on trying to understand, quantify and predict inter-individual variability of response to pharmacological intervention (either efficacy or toxicity). The aim of my communication is to present a few concrete preclinical or clinical applications of this approach. These have been performed by members of a recently created new unit entitled COMPO (COMPutational pharmacology and clinical Oncology, Inria-Inserm, Center for Cancer Research of Marseille, France) which uniquely gathers clinical oncologists, pharmacists and mathematicians. The three examples that will be presented consist of: 1) clinical dose adaptation of chemotherapy (e.g. cisplatin), or targeted therapy (e.g. sunitinib), 2) the design of one of the first model-driven clinical trials, including Bayesian adaptive treatment individualization and 3) model-driven optimal combination of cytotoxics and anti-angiogenics. To conclude, I will present a few ongoing studies involving the incorporation of higher dimensional data in an approach comining mechanistic modeling and machine learning termed mechanistic learning.</small>

															<small class="text-muted">While genetic mutations have long been accepted as a cause of intra-tumour heterogeneity, the role of phenotypic plasticity in drug resistance is becoming increasingly apparent. We study the phenotypic evolution of drug tolerant and drug sensitive sub-populations in non-small cell lung cancer through a non-local partial differential equation structured by age and phenotype. We clarify the role of phenotype plasticity on tumour persistence by recasting the model as a renewal equation and calculating the Malthusian parameter and basic reproduction number, demonstrate the role of phenotype heterogeneity in therapy resistance and use the renewal equation formulation to derive a model informed therapy schedule. We show that this model informed therapeutic schedule results in increased treatment efficacy when compared against the standard of care and drives tumour decay while avoiding the development of drug resistance.</small>

												      <span class="abs">Understanding the potential benefits of adaptive therapy for metastatic melanoma</span></br>
												      <p class="text-justify mr-2 ml-2">
															<small class="text-muted">Adaptive therapy is an evolution-based treatment approach that aims to maintain tumor volume by employing minimum effective drug doses or timed drug holidays. For successful adaptive therapy outcomes, it is critical to find the optimal timing of treatment switch points. Mathematical models are ideal tools to facilitate adaptive therapy dosing and switch time points. We developed two different mathematical models to examine interactions between drug-sensitive and resistant cells in a tumor. The first model assumes genetically fixed drug-sensitive and resistant populations that compete for limited resources. Resistant cell growth is inhibited by sensitive cells. The second model considers phenotypic switching between drug-sensitive and resistant cells. We calibrated each model to fit melanoma patient biomarker changes over time and predicted patient-specific adaptive therapy schedules. Overall, the models predict that adaptive therapy would have delayed time to progression by 6-25 months compared to continuous therapy with dose rates of 6%-74% relative to continuous therapy. We identified predictive factors driving the clinical time gained by adaptive therapy. The first model predicts 6-20 months gained from continuous therapy when the initial population of sensitive cells is large enough, and when the sensitive cells have a large competitive effect on resistant cells. The second model predicts 20-25 months gained from continuous therapy when the switching rate from resistant to sensitive cells is high and the growth rate of sensitive cells is low. This study highlights that there is a range of potential patient specific benefits of adaptive therapy, depending on the underlying mechanism of resistance, and identifies tumor specific parameters that modulate this benefit.</small>

												      <span class="abs">Plasticity in cancer cells and emergence of drug-induced resistance: what consequences for therapeutics?</span></br>
												      <p class="text-justify mr-2 ml-2">
															<small class="text-muted">I will present an evolutionary viewpoint on cancer, seen at the two time scales of (large-time) evolution in the genomes and of (short-time) evolution in the epigenetic landscape of a constituted genome. Drug-induced drug resistance, the biological and medical question I am tackling from a theoretical point of view, related to the plasticity of cancer cells, may be due to biological mechanisms of different natures, mere local regulation, epigenetic modifications (reversible) or genetic mutations (irreversible), according to the extent to which the genome of the cells in the population is affected. In this respect, the modelling framework of adaptive dynamics I will present is more likely to correspond biologically to epigenetic modifications, although eventual induction of emergent resistant cell clones due to mutations under drug pressure is never to be excluded. The built-in targets for theoretical therapeutic control present in the phenotype-structured PDE models I advocate are not supposed to represent well-defined molecular effects of the drugs in use, but rather functional effects, i.e., related to induction of cell death (cytotoxic drugs), or to proliferation in the sense of slowing down the cell division cycle without killing cells (cytostatic drugs). I propose that cell life-threatening drugs (cytotoxics) induce by far more resistance in the highly plastic cancer cell populations than drugs that only limit their growth (cytostatics), and that a rational combination of the two classes of drugs - and possibly others, adding relevant targets to the model - may be optimised to propose therapeutic control strategies to avoid the emergence of drug resistance in tumours. I address this optimal control problem in the context of two populations, healthy and cancer, both endowed with phenotypes evolving with drug pressure, and competing for space and nutrients in a non-local Lotka-Volterra-like way, taking thus into account a constraint of limiting unwanted adverse effects. Finally, I will present some transdisciplinary challenges of cancer modelling that should concern all mathematicians, cell biologists, evolutionary biologists and oncologists, aiming to go beyond the present state of the art in the treatments of cancer.</small>

												      <span class="abs">Drug resistance in cancer: the role of induction</span></br>
												      <p class="text-justify mr-2 ml-2">
															<small class="text-muted">Drug resistance in cancer chemotherapy is a major cause of treatment failure. The origins of resistance are complex: the resistant phenotype may be present before treatment is initiated (pre-existing), or may be acquired during the course of therapy. Pre-existing resistance is thought to be driven primarily by genetic alterations, but acquired resistance is more complex: does the resistant subpopulation arise spontaneously (genetically or via phenotype-switching), or is it induced by the drug itself? Such questions are difficult to answer, but the consequences may be profound in a clinical setting. In this talk, we present recent work, both mathematical and experimental, on understanding the origins of drug resistance, with special emphasis placed on the more prominent role induced resistance appears to be playing in recent literature. Minimal mathematical models are introduced, and are used to demonstrate that the ability of a drug to promote resistance may have a significant impact on optimal therapy design. Current work towards integrating such models with experimental data is also discussed, and further questions relating to the scheduling of multiple chemotherapies are posed. Future directions and open questions relating to the origins of drug resistance will also be discussed.</small>

												      <span class="abs">Modeling collaterally sensitive drug cycles: shaping heterogeneity to allow adaptive therapy</span></br>
												      <p class="text-justify mr-2 ml-2">
															<small class="text-muted">Despite major strides in the treatment of cancer, the development of drug resistance remains a major hurdle. One strategy which has been proposed to address this is the sequential application of drug therapies where resistance to one drug induces sensitivity to another drug, a concept called collateral sensitivity. Particularly, there is utility in a drug sequence which completes a cycle of such relationships. With such cycles, one could, in theory, generate infinitely long drug sequences which can be used in long term therapy to mitigate the evolution of resistance in a tumor. In this work, we explored the optimal therapeutic strategy using the drugs involved in such a cycle with an arbitrary length, N (>=2). We developed a mathematical model for this research, in which tumor cells are classified as one of N subpopulations represented as { R_i|i =1,2,...,N}. Each subpopulation, R_i , is resistant to Drug i and each subpopulation, R _{ i -1} (or R_N , if i =1), is sensitive to it, so that R_i increases under Drug i as it is resistant to it, and after drug-switching, decreases under Drug i+1 as it is sensitive to that drug(s). Based on the model, we found that there is an initial period of time in which the tumor is `shaped' into a specific makeup of each subpopulation, at which time all the drugs are equally effective ( R* ). After this shaping period, all the drugs are quickly switched with duration relative to their efficacy in order to maintain each subpopulation, consistent with the ideas underlying adaptive therapy. Additionally, we have developed methodologies to administer the optimal regimen under clinical or experimental situations in which no drug parameters and limited information of trackable populations data (all the subpopulations or only total population) are known. The therapy simulation based on these methodologies showed consistency with the theoretical effect of optimal therapy.</small>

												      <span class="abs">Multi-drug Adaptive Therapy</span></br>
												      <p class="text-justify mr-2 ml-2">
															<small class="text-muted">Cancer is an evolutionary and ecological process driven by heritable mutations whereby subclones compete on a fitness landscape. Viewing cancer through this eco-evo lens has led to the development of several evolutionary therapy (ET) paradigms. These paradigms have already proven a degree of success in preclinical experiments and clinical trials using an approach known as adaptive therapy (AT). A stable population of treatment-sensitive cells is maintained in order to suppress the growth rate of smaller resistant populations. This adaptive approach means that each patient's treatment is truly personalized on the basis of the tumor's state and response rather than a one-size-fits-all fixed treatment regime. However, there remain several open challenges in designing adaptive therapies. For example, it is not yet clear how to extend these evolutionarily enlightened therapeutic concepts to multiple treatments. Is it evolutionarily optimal to reproduce the single-drug adaptive therapy in a sequential setting or in a concomitant setting? We present a cancer treatment case study (metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer) as a point of departure to illustrate three novel concepts to aid the design of multidrug adaptive therapies. First, frequency-dependent "cycles" of tumor evolution can trap tumor evolution in a periodic, controllable loop. Second, the availability and selection of treatments may limit the evolutionary ‚Äö√Ñ√∫absorbing region‚Äö√Ñ√π reachable by the tumor. Third, the velocity of evolution significantly influences the optimal timing of drug sequences. These three conceptual advances provide a path forward for multidrug adaptive therapy.</small>
